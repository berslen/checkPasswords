It is a program that checks any given passwords with previously leaked passwords on the internet by using haveibeenpwned.com's API.

If you dont want to give your passowrds to their website because you think that it is not safe to give your passwords to a website. My program is here to serve. It only uses hashed version of your passwords and sends the part of your hashed password to their API to check whether it has been leaked before.
